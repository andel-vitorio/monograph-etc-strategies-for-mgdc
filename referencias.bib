  abstract  = {Networked control systems often send information across the communication network in a periodic manner. The selected period, however, must assure adequate system performance over a wide range of operating conditions and this conservative' choice may result in significant over-provisioning of the communication network. This observation has motivated the use of sporadic transmission across the network's feedback channels. Event-triggering represents one way of generating such sporadic transmissions. In event-triggered feedback, a sensor transmits when some internal measure of the novelty in the sensor information exceeds a specified threshold. In particular, this means that when the gap between the current and the more recently transmitted sensor measurements exceeds a state-dependent threshold, then the information is transmitted across the channel. The state-dependent thresholds are chosen in a way that preserves commonly used stability concepts such as input-to-state stability or {\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathcal L{\}}{\_}2{\$}stability. This approach for threshold selection therefore provides a systematic way of triggering transmissions that provides some guarantees on overall control system performance. While early work in event-triggering focused on control applications, this technique can also be used in distributed estimation and distributed optimization. This chapter reviews recent progress in the use of state-dependent event-triggering in embedded control, networked control systems, distributed estimation, and distributed optimization.},

A novel dynamic switching ETS is proposed to reduce the number of transmitted signals. A stochastic model is used for deception attacks, where the system states are corrupted by attackers. Under this framework, the system to be investigated is modeled as a new switched system. By using the constructed Lyapunov function, sufficient criteria are derived to guarantee the exponential mean-square stability and L∞ performance. Subsequently, the corresponding controller is designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the dynamic ETS is illustrated by using an unmanned aerial vehicle system.}

In this sense, control system resources (e.g. computation and communication capabilities) can be saved. A sufficient condition for the existence of an event-triggering condition and the corresponding even-triggered controller design are obtained by means of linear matrix inequality techniques. In addition, the avoidance of Zeno behavior is guaranteed. Furthermore, a result on the event-triggered emulation of a continuous-time feedback controller for Lur'e systems is presented. Finally, numerical simulations are given to illustrate the theoretical results along with some concluding remarks.}

The parameter uncertainties in the nonlinear plant can be captured effectively by utilizing the membership functions with upper and lower bounds. To reduce the utilization of limited network bandwidth, an ET communication mechanism is applied. A novel type of DOFC subject to parameter uncertainties, ET communication mechanism and transmission delay is proposed, where the membership functions are different from those of the fuzzy models. Consequently, the closed-loop system is with mismatched membership functions, which hampers the stability analysis and controller design. To promote the stability analysis and achieve a better control performance, the information of membership functions and slack matrices are utilized for obtaining the main results. Finally, a simulation example is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.}

Different from the existing finite-time problems, not only the problem of finite-time boundedness (FTBs) but also the problem of input-output finite-time stability (IO-FTSy) are considered in this paper. To effectively use the network resources, an ETCS is formulated for switched systems. Considering that not all the states could be measured, thus an event-triggered observer is constructed, and then, an observer-based resilient controller is devised, which robustly stabilizes the given systems in the meaning of finite-time control. Based on time-delay method and Lyapunov functional approach, interesting results are derived to verify the properties of the FTBs and the IO-FTSy of the event-triggered (ET) closed-loop error switched systems. All the matrix inequalities can be converted to linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) so as to simultaneously obtain the controller gain and observer gain. Finally, the applicability of the proposed control scheme is verified via a boost converter circuit system.},

First, a switched affine observer is developed to estimate unmeasurable states. Then by combining the sampled-data control approach, a less conservative mode-dependent dynamic event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is established. The proposed dynamic ETM cannot only avoid Zeno behavior but also reduce the network transmission burden effectively. Further, based on time-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and state-dependent switching laws, a set of feasible ISPS conditions are presented in the LMI forms by means of singular value decomposition. The designed switching law depends upon the sampled-data information of the estimated state and gets rid of the chattering phenomenon. Finally, an application example of the DC-DC flyback converter is given to verify the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.},

Due to the significantly increasing interest that DC power systems have been gaining lately, researchers investigated several issues that need to be considered during this transition interval from current conventional power systems into modern smart grids involving DC microgrids. The efforts of these researchers were mostly directed toward studying the feasibility of implementing DC distribution on a given application, DC distribution design-related aspects such as the system architecture or its voltage level, or the unique challenges associated with DC power systems protection and stability. In this paper, these research efforts were categorized, discussed and analyzed to evaluate where we currently stand on the migration path from the overwhelming fully AC power system to a more flexible hybrid AC/DC power system. Moreover, the impediments against more deployment of DC distribution systems and some of the proposed solutions to overcome those impediments in the literature will be discussed. One of the obstacles to increased DC system penetration is the lack of standards. This problem will be discussed, and the most recent standardization efforts will also be summarized and presented.}

  abstract = {This article investigates the stability of functional differential systems on networks adopting event-triggered multi-delayed impulsive control. We construct a new event-triggered mechanism (ETM) type using the Lyapunov function and the network topology. Combined with the ETM and multi-delayed impulsive control, in which the impulsive jumps are related to the current and past states, we propose a multi-delayed event-triggered impulsive control strategy. This controller will execute the control tasks only when the systems violate the preset ETM. In the view of the Razumikhin method and the graph theory, some criteria are given to avoiding Zeno behavior under this ETM and achieving exponential stability, which is related to the event-triggered parameters, network topology, and impulsive intensity. As an application of our theoretical results, a class of coupled oscillation systems is considered and numerical simulations are presented to verify the practicability and effectiveness.}

  abstract       = {The DC microgrid system is composed by converters that operate like feeders and loads. Among these loads, we highlight the constant power loads (CPLs) that may cause instability in the microgrid, observed in the form of undesired oscillations due to its negative impedance behavior. Therefore, this work proposes to use performance indices and stability margins to evaluate state and output feedback control strategies for stabilization of DC microgrids. In particular, it is proposed to evaluate the stability margin of the proposed methodologies by means of the impedance relations in the microgrid based on the Middlebrook criterion. Our simulations and tests showed the relation between the performance and stability degradation and the microgrid impedances variation.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a nonlinear voltage control for a DC islanded microgrid (MG) is proposed. This control method is a new nonlinear decentralized backstepping based strategy for voltage control of DC MG based on Sepic converter with nonlinear loads such as constant power loads (CPLs). The effect of CPL is to realize a load with negative resistance for DC MG that impacts the power quality of the power system and causes negative damping. The major purpose of the proposed controller is to improve the transient performance of MG with the Plug and Play (PnP) feature in the presence of load change and CPL. To consider the effects of such loads on the proposed control method, a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) along with backstepping controller is introduced to estimate the uncertain terms such as CPL and load currents as well as the current transferred between DGUs. The proposed method only measures the local voltage and current quantities without any need for additional information about the grid topology and its parameters. This method successfully regulates the point of common coupling (PCC) voltage. The stability of the method is proved via Lyapunov theory and its features are verified with simulation and some experiment tests.}

  abstract = {The Smart Grid (SG) is a system with a lot of controls and communications. Both local and global controls are included in these controls. One of the advantages of SG over a traditional utility grid is that it uses a two-way communication mechanism at each stage. However, challenges such as complexity, data gathering and administration, and so on are brought into the SG system as a result of this two-way communication. As a result, an SG needs connectivity, automation and device tracking. The Internet of Things is used to do this (IoT). This study presents an IoT-enabled smart grid monitoring and control system in a computer network. Here the IoT module has been used in monitoring the network which is integrated with (MLDRNN). Renewable (DER) should be combined in grids to make electricity supply more reliable and reduce transmission losses. The control system of smart grid has been enhanced using (CPCS). The suggested system is scalable, modular, and allows for the interoperability of various types of inverters, as well as data transmission over a secure communication channel. All of these characteristics, combined with its low cost, make the created control system and monitoring platform ideal for monitoring smart microgrids online. The experimental results show scalability, QoS, power consumption, efficiency of the network.}

  abstract = {This study provides a comprehensive and fresh review of load frequency control (LFC) in multi-area interconnected power systems (MAIPSs). The central tasks of LFC are to keep frequency variations as minimum as possible to achieve an acceptable level of stability. This research provides a complete view, from early classical control to recent technologies and modern techniques considering strategies, robust, optimal, self-tuning, and adaptive controllers for LFC in MAIPSs. Fuzzy control and earlier and recent optimization algorithms also are analyzed. The linearity, nonlinearity, and uncertainty of LFC models are also investigated. This review emphasizes recent technological advances and novel control strategies. LFC is also considered with the integration of wind, photovoltaic, electric vehicles, and storage devices. Besides, the utilization of machine learning and reinforcement techniques is examined. Further, LFC in smart grids and modern complex power systems concerning limited communication bandwidth, communication failure, and cyber-attacks are also investigated. This review provides an in-depth and detailed diagnosis of the challenges associated with LFC in modern and complex power systems. This work may be valuable for studies and practitioners interested in LFC. It, in detail, investigates future efforts and directions to enhance LFC performance, stability, and reliability in the face of increasing complexity and uncertainty.}
