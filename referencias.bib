  abstract  = {Networked control systems often send information across the communication network in a periodic manner. The selected period, however, must assure adequate system performance over a wide range of operating conditions and this conservative' choice may result in significant over-provisioning of the communication network. This observation has motivated the use of sporadic transmission across the network's feedback channels. Event-triggering represents one way of generating such sporadic transmissions. In event-triggered feedback, a sensor transmits when some internal measure of the novelty in the sensor information exceeds a specified threshold. In particular, this means that when the gap between the current and the more recently transmitted sensor measurements exceeds a state-dependent threshold, then the information is transmitted across the channel. The state-dependent thresholds are chosen in a way that preserves commonly used stability concepts such as input-to-state stability or {\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathcal L{\}}{\_}2{\$}stability. This approach for threshold selection therefore provides a systematic way of triggering transmissions that provides some guarantees on overall control system performance. While early work in event-triggering focused on control applications, this technique can also be used in distributed estimation and distributed optimization. This chapter reviews recent progress in the use of state-dependent event-triggering in embedded control, networked control systems, distributed estimation, and distributed optimization.},

  abstract = {Based on the event-triggered scheme (ETS), the L∞ control problem is considered for networked control systems subject to stochastic deception attacks. A novel dynamic switching ETS is proposed to reduce the number of transmitted signals. A stochastic model is used for deception attacks, where the system states are corrupted by attackers. Under this framework, the system to be investigated is modeled as a new switched system. By using the constructed Lyapunov function, sufficient criteria are derived to guarantee the exponential mean-square stability and L∞ performance. Subsequently, the corresponding controller is designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the dynamic ETS is illustrated by using an unmanned aerial vehicle system.}

The unknown nonlinearity is conventionally assumed to lie in a given sector while the sector bounds are known. In the presence of event-triggered feedback mechanisms, the control input is only computed and updated when a specific event occurs. In this sense, control system resources (e.g. computation and communication capabilities) can be saved. A sufficient condition for the existence of an event-triggering condition and the corresponding even-triggered controller design are obtained by means of linear matrix inequality techniques. In addition, the avoidance of Zeno behavior is guaranteed. Furthermore, a result on the event-triggered emulation of a continuous-time feedback controller for Lur'e systems is presented. Finally, numerical simulations are given to illustrate the theoretical results along with some concluding remarks.}

The parameter uncertainties in the nonlinear plant can be captured effectively by utilizing the membership functions with upper and lower bounds. To reduce the utilization of limited network bandwidth, an ET communication mechanism is applied. A novel type of DOFC subject to parameter uncertainties, ET communication mechanism and transmission delay is proposed, where the membership functions are different from those of the fuzzy models. Consequently, the closed-loop system is with mismatched membership functions, which hampers the stability analysis and controller design. To promote the stability analysis and achieve a better control performance, the information of membership functions and slack matrices are utilized for obtaining the main results. Finally, a simulation example is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.}

Different from the existing finite-time problems, not only the problem of finite-time boundedness (FTBs) but also the problem of input-output finite-time stability (IO-FTSy) are considered in this paper. To effectively use the network resources, an ETCS is formulated for switched systems. Considering that not all the states could be measured, thus an event-triggered observer is constructed, and then, an observer-based resilient controller is devised, which robustly stabilizes the given systems in the meaning of finite-time control. Based on time-delay method and Lyapunov functional approach, interesting results are derived to verify the properties of the FTBs and the IO-FTSy of the event-triggered (ET) closed-loop error switched systems. All the matrix inequalities can be converted to linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) so as to simultaneously obtain the controller gain and observer gain. Finally, the applicability of the proposed control scheme is verified via a boost converter circuit system.},

First, a switched affine observer is developed to estimate unmeasurable states. Then by combining the sampled-data control approach, a less conservative mode-dependent dynamic event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is established. The proposed dynamic ETM cannot only avoid Zeno behavior but also reduce the network transmission burden effectively. Further, based on time-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and state-dependent switching laws, a set of feasible ISPS conditions are presented in the LMI forms by means of singular value decomposition. The designed switching law depends upon the sampled-data information of the estimated state and gets rid of the chattering phenomenon. Finally, an application example of the DC-DC flyback converter is given to verify the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.},
